## Go by Example - IT (gobyexample.it)

Italian translation for [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com),
a site that teaches Go via annotated example programs.

The italian version of Go by Example can be reached at 
[http://gobyexample.it](http://gobyexample.it).

### Translation

The Italian localization is up to [italian golang community (golang-it)](http://golangit.github.io).
Feel free to [open a bug](https://github.com/golangit/gobyexample-it/issues) or [open a pull request](https://github.com/golangit/gobyexample-it/pulls) to report bugs and typos.

### Overview

The Go by Example site is built by extracting code and
comments from source files in `examples` and rendering
them via the `templates` into a static `public`
directory. The programs implementing this build process
are in `tools`, along with some vendor'd dependencies
in `vendor`.

The built `public` directory can be served by any
static content system. The production site uses S3 and
CloudFront, for example.

### Building

To build the site you'll need Go and Python installed. Run:

```console
$ go get github.com/russross/blackfriday
$ tools/build
$ open public/index.html
```

To build continuously in a loop:

```console
$ tools/build-loop
```
